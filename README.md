# üíâ Diabetes Prediction App

An intelligent, interactive web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user input. 
Powered by machine learning models and wrapped in a clean Gradio interface, this project serves as a demonstration of how AI can assist in healthcare diagnostics.

## üìå About the Project

This app predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on several health-related parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and more. The backend is powered by machine learning models ‚Äî specifically **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚Äî trained on a well-known dataset related to diabetes diagnosis.

The project highlights:

- üî¨ Use of **SVM and KNN classifiers**
- ‚ö° Instant predictions via a web interface
- üß† Pre-trained model with `.pkl` serialization
- üéõÔ∏è Clean and responsive UI with **Gradio**

This project is meant for **educational purposes**, showing how machine learning can be deployed for real-world predictions in healthcare.
